## ✍️ 2. Summarize a Text

> **Prompt:**  
> Summarize the following text in three sentences:  
> _The AI4Uni project, co-funded by the Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union, aims to enhance the organizational capacities of higher education institutions (HEIs) in responsibly adopting and utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The motivation behind the project stems from an increasing demand for universities to not only stay competitive in a rapidly evolving digital landscape, but also to lead by example in the ethical implementation of AI tools in education and administration. Many HEIs lack the necessary legal, technical, and strategic expertise to effectively deploy AI, which may result in resistance or misuse, especially in administrative or academic processes involving sensitive personal data. Through training, awareness-raising, and tailored AI solutions, AI4Uni seeks to address these gaps and foster a culture of responsible innovation within universities. The project brings together international partners from Europe, Africa, and North America to exchange knowledge, design practical tools, and establish frameworks that can support universities in using AI to automate repetitive tasks, improve efficiency, and protect human-centered values such as fairness, transparency, and accountability. The ultimate goal of AI4Uni is not only to introduce technology, but to empower institutions and individuals to make informed, ethical, and strategic decisions about when and how AI should be used._

> _During today’s AI4Uni coordination meeting, we conducted a deep dive into the layered architecture of AI deployment workflows within university administrative systems, particularly focusing on the integration of modular NLP-based agents within legacy ERP platforms. The discussion began with a presentation on hybrid infrastructure models combining on-premise servers with cloud-based inference pipelines to ensure compliance with both GDPR and institutional IT policies. Participants raised concerns regarding latency in multi-node orchestration scenarios when deploying language models for real-time document classification and routing. A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to evaluating zero-shot versus few-shot prompting strategies in multilingual contexts, particularly for Slavic and Semitic language inputs. Benchmarking studies were referenced, including token-level confusion matrices and F1 scores from previous pilot implementations. Moreover, issues related to prompt injection attacks, model drift in domain-specific deployments, and the interpretability of transformer attention weights were discussed. The meeting concluded with a proposal to develop a university-wide AI governance framework, accompanied by a standardized prompt library and a shared audit protocol for monitoring AI-assisted administrative decisions._
